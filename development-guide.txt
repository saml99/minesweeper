Development Approach
--------------------

These are just some tips on how you can go about constructing the game.  Each exercise will build on the next etc.

1. Mock Minefield
Start with constructing a web page that displays a mock set of minesweeper tiles.  Start with a basic minesweeper.html file then use a CSS grid to display a 5x5 minesweeper.

2. Programatic generation of a minefield
Use javascript to create the minefield based on height and width parameters.
Create a width and height selector using html on the form.  Create a button to generate (display) the minefield from the parameters.

3. Identifying your DOM Elements
Change your javascript code to ensure each element that has been generated has a unique identifier.  You'll need this for the later steps.

4. Events for the minefield
Use javascript actions to create a message box when a tile has been clicked.  The message box should display which tile was selected - ie the identifier.
